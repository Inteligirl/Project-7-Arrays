# C++ Class Project Gratuity Calculator

This programming challenge as outline in class.

## Project specifications:

Create a CharConverter class that performs various operations on strings.  It should have the following two public member functions to start with.  

The uppercase member function accepts a string and returns a copy of it with all lowercase letters converted to uppercase.  If a character is already uppercase, or is not a letter, it should be left alone.
The properWords member function accepts a string of words separated by spaces and returns a copy of it with the first letter of each word converted to uppercase.
Write a simple program that uses the class.  It should prompt the user to input a string.  Then it should call the properWords function and display the resulting string.  Finally, it should call the uppercase function and display the resulting string.  The program should loop to allow additional strings to be converted and displayed until the user chooses to quit.

## Thought process

I understand the concept of arrays from my previous logic class. However, I'm still struggling on managing classes and objects. The first push was only a template. I will be reworking it until I understand what each line is doing. I definately see some areas that need to be cleaner or shorter.
